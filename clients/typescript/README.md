# @snugkv/client

TypeScript/Node.js client for SnugKV.

The client automatically pipelines commands issued during the same JavaScript turn. Application code does not need to create a pipeline explicitly.

```ts
import { SnugKV } from "@snugkv/client";

const client = new SnugKV({ host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6383 });
await client.connect();

const a = client.set("a", "1");
const b = client.set("b", "2");
const c = client.get("c");

await Promise.all([a, b, c]);
```

Those three calls are encoded into one contiguous RESP payload and normally written to the socket with one `socket.write()`.

## Options

```ts
new SnugKV({
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 6383,
  autoPipeline: true,
  autoPipelineMaxCommands: 256,
  autoPipelineMaxBytes: 1024 * 1024,
});
```

Automatic pipelining is enabled by default. A batch flushes on the next microtask, or immediately when a configured command/byte threshold is reached.
